This will likely be a placeholder but this application is designed to view, add to, and in one case update three different databases for an employee registry, as of right now I would say this assignment is 85% complete with only the view roles, manager id linking, and update employees functionality not working. Im getting tutoring on friday to clean this up because there were a good number of extra bits I wasnt able to figure out either.
